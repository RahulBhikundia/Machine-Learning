## Naive - Bayes Algorithm

Supervised machine learning algorithm which is used for Classification

* Naive: Occurence of certain feature is independent of other feature 
* Bayes: It is based on Bayes Theorem

### Bayes Theorem:
Bayes Theorem is used to determine the probability of a Hypthesis with prior knowledge. It depends on conditional probability

```
P(A/B) = (P(B/A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(A/B) : Posterior Probability
P(B/A) : Likelihood Probability
